# Builder_Design_Pattern in c#
Builder Pattern:

It is a creational design pattern, which allows constructing complex objects step by step.
Builder patterns makes it possible to produce different products or representations using the same construction process.

UML Diagram
The UML class diagram for the implementation of the builder design pattern is given below:


Builder: This is an interface which is used to define all the steps to create a product.
ConcreteBuilder: This is a class which implements the Builder interface to create a complex product.
Product: This is a class which defines the parts of the complex object which are generated by the builder pattern.
Director: This is a class which is used to construct an object using the builder interface.

Command Pattern Example

The classes, interfaces, and objects in the above class diagram can be identified as follows:
IVehicleBuilder - Builder interface
HeroBuilder & HondaBuilder- Concrete Builder
Vehicle- Product
Vehicle Creator - Director
